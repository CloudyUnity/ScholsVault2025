I noticed multithreading on one of the computing exams, did this used to be a part of the course or should we expect more complex programming concepts / comp sci topics / maths / cybersecurity / compression / encoding / etc

Are we allowed calculators/log books into all exams

How lenient is the exam on syntax errors / spelling mistakes / etc

Are there any language features not allowed?
