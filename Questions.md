I noticed multithreading on one of the computing exams, did this used to be a part of the course or should we expect more complex programming concepts beyond what we've covered

Are we allowed calculators/log books into all exams?
Which formulae/tables will be given for the maths paper and EIT?

How lenient is the exam on syntax errors / spelling mistakes / etc
Same with maths mistakes in the mathy questions

Are there any language features not allowed?

Do we need to memorize the workings for certain equations like OLS in stats?

Who are all the authors of the papers / How can we find out?
	(If we have any authors who haven't taught us (STATS) then that could be a problem)
	Once answered add a new tag to all past paper questions given by those authors

Is it possible for any Year 2 Semester 2 content to appear on the papers?

In the maths exam, do you have time for all 6 questions or just the 4 required?
Can you skip the stats question?

Do we need to follow kens coding standard in the java question?
