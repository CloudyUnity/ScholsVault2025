We'll use a right-handed coordinate system. Point the thumb in the z+ direction and curl fingers from x to y

Implicit Equations:
	$f(x, y) = 0$
	For example:
		$y - mx - c = 0$
		$f(x, y) = y - mx - c$

Parametric Equations:
	$x = f_1 (t)$
	$y = f_2 (t)$
	For example:
		$x = cos(\theta)$
		$y = sin(\theta)$
