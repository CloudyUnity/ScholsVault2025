Information Model (IM)
	A representation of concepts, relationships, constraints, rules and operations to specify data semantics for a chosen domain of discourse
	Why use models
		Quicker and easier to build
		Used in simulation
		Evolves with knowledge
		Choice in details to include
		Represents real or imaginary things from any domain with any materials
		Helps understand and communicate complex systems
		Minimizes risk by detecting errors and omissions early in the design cycle 
		Drives implementation 
	Models are abstractions of the real world
	There is no correct model, just ones more or less suited to a particular task
