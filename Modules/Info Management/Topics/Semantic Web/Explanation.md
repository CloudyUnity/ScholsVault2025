Challenges with managing data
	Volume
		Too much data, not enough storage
	Velocity
		Data needs to processed as its streamed to maximize value
	Validity
		Data protections, privacy and ethics
	Variety
		Not all data is structured (text, audio, video, etc)

The web has made data easily available due to easy publication and infrastructure for retrieving, representing docs and accessing data

Semantic Interoperation
	Understanding what data means
	Linking data in insightful ways
	Automated support for data integration
	Smart applications

Web of Documents
	Created by humans for humans
	Links between docs have little meaning for machines and little structured info
	Like a global file system of documents

Web of Data
	Like a global database of descriptions
	Links between things have high structure 
	Designed for both humans and computers 

The Semantic Web
	This is a web of data
	Provides an env where apps can query data, draw inferences using vocab, etc
	Needs a huge amount of data in a standard format. Relationships among data needs to be available 

Linked Data
	Started off as an initiative called the Linking Open Data (LOD) project
	A global initiative to publish and interlink structured data on the web 
	Used standardized technologies:
		Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) to name things
		Resource Description Framework (RDF) to represent things
		HTTP Infrastructure to obtain those representations
