Summary:
	Cancer treatment machine (Therac-25) was the first to use software in 1985
	They employed a hobbyist programmer to do the software stuff
	The hardware side had no proper limits in place to prevent accidents
	The machine often printed out error codes with no manual to decode them, as such users became desensitised to them
	One warning, Warning 53 was caused by trying to change the ray type while the magnetic disks were rearranging. This software error caused tens of thousands of rads to be sent into the patient 
	The company failed to notice, address and solve this issue, leading to many many deaths

The Deaths (1985-1987):
