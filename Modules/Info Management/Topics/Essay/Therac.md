Summary:
	Cancer treatment machine (Therac-25) was the first to use software in 1985
	They employed a hobbyist programmer to do the software stuff
	The hardware side had no proper limits in place to prevent accidents
	The machine often printed out error codes with no manual to decode them, as such users became desensitised to them
	One warning, Warning 53 was caused by trying to change the ray type while the magnetic disks were rearranging. This software error caused tens of thousands of rads to be sent into the patient 
	The company failed to notice, address and solve this issue, leading to many many deaths

This wasn't a one-off incident. Many more radiation overdose accidents have occurred since

The Issues:
	Overconfidence in software:
		There's a widespread belief that software doesn't fail
		In safety critical systems today some hardware backups/interlocks are being replaced or controlled by software 
		Systems need more protection against software errors
	No hardware limits:
	Company stuff...
