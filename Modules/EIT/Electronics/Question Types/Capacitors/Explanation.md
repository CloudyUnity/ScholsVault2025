Capacitor:
	A two terminal element that stores energy in an electric field
	Formed by two parallel conductors separated by a dielectric
	When voltage is applied both conductors possess charge equal in magnitude but opposite signs
	Capacitance (C):
		Ability of a substance to hold an electric charge		
		C $= q/V$
			$q$ is the charge on the positive conductor
		C $= \epsilon A / d$
			$\epsilon$ is the electrical permittivity
			$d$ is the distance between conductors
		$I =$ C$\dfrac{dV}{dt}$
			Current passes through capacitor only if voltage is changing

When current passes through a capacitor there is no movement of charge between the conductors
The current without movement of charge is called displacement current
This is due to the changing electric field in the dielectric inducing charge flow

Farad ($F$):	
	$F = C/V$
		$C$ is coulomb

Energy stored in capacitor:
	$w(t) =$ C $\dfrac{V^2 (t)}{2}$

Capacitors in series:
	$\dfrac{1}{C} = \dfrac{1}{C_1} + \dfrac{1}{C_2} + \dots + \dfrac{1}{C_n}$

Capacitors in parallel:
	$C = C_1 + C_2 + \dots + C_n$
