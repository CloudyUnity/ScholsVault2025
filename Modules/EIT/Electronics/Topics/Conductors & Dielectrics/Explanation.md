Conductor: Material which an $emf$ facilitates current to adequately
	Aka electrons will move in the direction of the anode
	The materials electrons are loosely bound
	Examples: Silver

Semiconductor: Material which an $emf$ facilitates current to moderately
	Examples: Silicon, Germanium

Dielectric: Material which an $emf$ facilitates current to poorly
	These materials electrons are tightly bound
	Examples: Pretty much everything that's not a metal
	Also called Insulators

Silicon is a metalloid
90% of earths crust is composed of silicate (Silicon compounds)
Silicon has a crystal structure due to it forming Si$_5$ compounds to fill at least 1 of the shells

How semiconductors work:
	When an $emf$ is applied across a semiconductor the free electrons move towards the anode. A hole remains which is filled by the neighbouring atoms electrons
	The hole has a small positive charge (Note the hole is an atom missing electrons)
	Hole keeps moving until its filled by cathode electrons
	Hence why a current moves from the anode to the cathode (Positive to negative)

Semiconductor Doping:
	Addition of impurities to an intrinsic semiconductor to enhance the conductivity
	Doped semiconductors are referred to as extrinsic semiconductors
	N-Type:
		N-type semiconductors are formed by doping the silicon to have the middle atom X with a valence of +5. This leaves a free electron when bonded to form XSi$_4$
		Examples: Arsenic, Atimony and Phosphorus
		Negatively charged, majority carriers are electrons
	P-Type:
		Formed by doping with a valence of +3. Leaves a hole when bonded to form XSi$_4$
		Examples: Aluminium, Boron and Gallium
		Positively charged, majority carriers are holes

Semiconductor Diodes:
	Form an element from a P-Type then N-Type semiconductors
	The junction of the two is the depletion layer/region, has no majority carrier
	Depletion layer has no charge and is a poor conductor
	An applied variable voltage source causes #todo
	If the anode is connected to the P-Type the diode is forward-biased
		At $V \approx 0.7$ (Si) the p.d. is strong enough to force carriers across the depletion layer and the current flows freely
	If the voltage is applied in the reverse direction hard enough ($V \approx -25$) the diode breaks down and the electrons are forced across the crystal despite it being entirely depletion layer

Static Resistance:
	Resistance offered by the diode to the flow of DC
	The ratio of DC voltage applied across the diode to the DC flowing through it
	$R_{dc} = \dfrac{V_{dc}}{I_{dc}}$

Zener Diodes:
	Designed to operate in the breakdown region
	Won't overheat or damage the diode

Light Emitting Diodes (LED):
	Emits light on application of an $emf$
	In the depletion layer when holes are filled it causes electrons to drop an energy level emitting a photon at a frequency defined by the material used

Photodiodes:
	Conduct current on application of light
	When light photons hit electrons it knocks them out of their orbits and they become free electrons and holes
	Dark Current:
		The current direction in darkness is opposite the direction in light
		Dark current must be minimised to maximise the device sensitivity

Forward Resistance:
	The resistance offered by the diode in its forward-biasing condition
	Static forward resistance for DC
	Dynamic forward resistance for AC
