`D` Joint Probability Mass Function ($P(X = x, Y = y)$)
	Probability of both events happening
	You can prove whether $X$ and $Y$ are independent if $P(X = x, Y = y) = P(X = x)P(Y = y)$ 

`C` Joint Probability Mass Function ($f_{X, Y} (x, y)$) 
	#todo 

`D` Marginal Probability Mass Function ($P(X = x)$)
	Given a JPMF find the probability of one r.v. decoupled from the other
	$P(X = x) = \sum^y P(X = x, Y = y)$
