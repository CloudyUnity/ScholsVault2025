> Find turning point of $f$

> $2x = -3$
> $x = -\dfrac{3}{2}$
> $-2 \leq -\dfrac{3}{2} \leq 2$
> $f$ is not injective as the turning point is within the domain
> $15 = x^2 + 3x - 10$
> $x^2 + 3x - 25 = 0$
> $x = 3.72, x = -6.72$
> These values are outside the domain thus $15$ is not mapped
> $f$ is not surjective

>5 as if you assume person $i$ has written $i \ mod \ 1,000,001$ lines of code then at least 5 people must have the same number of lines of code

 1 Every man has shaved one other man
 2 No man can shave himself
 3 No man had been shaved by more than one other man
 4 One man had never been shaved by another
Are there more or less than 100 men in the loge?
.
Assume n men
man 1 shaves man 2
man 2 shaves man 3
...
man n-1 shaves man n
man 1 does not get shaved
man n has nobody to shave
.
Assume infinite men
Now the problem works
Therefore there are infinite men which is greater than 100
