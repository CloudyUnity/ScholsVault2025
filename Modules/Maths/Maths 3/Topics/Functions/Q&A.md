> Find turning point of $f$
> $f'(x) = 2x + 3$
> $2x = -3$
> $x = -\dfrac{3}{2}$
> $-2 \leq -\dfrac{3}{2} \leq 2$
> $f$ is not injective as the turning point is within the domain
> $15 = x^2 + 3x - 10$
> $x^2 + 3x - 25 = 0$
> $x = 3.72, x = -6.72$
> These values are outside the domain thus $15$ is not mapped
> $f$ is not surjective

>5 as if you assume person $i$ has written $i \ mod \ 1,000,001$ lines of code then at least 5 people must have the same number of lines of code
