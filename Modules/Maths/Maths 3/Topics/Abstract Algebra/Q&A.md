 (a)
 Yes as $3^p \times 3^q = 3^q \times 3^p$ thus the BO is associative 
 (b)
Yes as $3^p \times 3^0 = 3^p$ where $3^0 = e$ 
 (c)
 No as there are no numbers where $3^p \times 3^q = 3^0$ where $p, q \neq 0$ 
 $3^{pq} = 3^0$
 $pq = 0$
 Impossible

> (a)
 Yes as $(x_1, y_1) + (x_2, y_2) = (x_2, y_2) + (x_1, y_1)$
 (b)
 Yes as $(x_1, y_1) + (0, 0) = (x_1, y_1)$ 
 (c)
$x_1 + 2y_2 = 0$
 Inverse $= (-x_1, -y_2)$
 $-x_1 - 2y_2 = 0 \leftrightarrow x_1 + 2y_2 = 0$
 Yes all elements have an inverse
 (d)
  A line
