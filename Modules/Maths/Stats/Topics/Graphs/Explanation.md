Exploration is when there is a message in the data and the display helps to understand it
Communication is when we know something and the display communicates it to others
Decoration is when the display is engaging and enlivens a presentation

Histograms:
	Quantitative Continuous data
	Can use absolute or relative frequencies
	To Plot:
		Define $B$ the number of classes
		Compute the range of the observations
		Subdivide the range into $B$ classes
		Count how many observation falls into each class
		Relative:
			Divide the count of each class by the total range width

Bar plot:
	Qualitative data
	Shows absolute/relative frequency of a variable

Scatterplots:
	Quantitative data
	Represents values of one variable against another
	Plots pairs of data

Box plot:
	Pair of Quantitative and Qualitative variables
	Splits observations into quartiles:
		$q_0$ the minimum
		$q_{25}$ the 1st quartile
		$q_{50}$ the median
		$q_{75}$ the 3rd quartile
		$q_{100}$ the maximum
	Outliers are often represented separately
	Be aware $q_0 = q_{25} \lor q_{100} = q_{75}$ can happen
	Interquartile Range:
		IQR = $q_{75} - q_{25}$ 

Left-Skewed graphs have less frequency on lower values
	They have a tail on the left
Right-Skewed graphs have less frequency on higher values
	They have a tail on the right
