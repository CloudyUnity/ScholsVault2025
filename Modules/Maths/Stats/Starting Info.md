Descriptive Statistics is description and summarization of data
Inferential Statistics is use of data to generalize findings 

Population:
	A set of units which have at least one or more common characteristics 
	There can be finite and infinite populations

Sample:
	Samples are drawn from populations of interest. The size is lower than the population size

Unit
	A single observation or measurement

Variable
	A characteristic or quality that can be measured and assumes different values per unit

Quantitative:
	Discrete is predefined intervals
	Continuous is any numbers

Qualitative:
	Nominal are unordered categories
	Ordinal are ordered categories

Contingency Table:
	Visualising joint frequency distribution of two categorical variables

Absolute Frequency = $f$
Relative Frequency = $\tilde f$
Cumulative Relative Frequency = $f_c$
	$f_{ci} = \overset{i}{\underset{k = 1}{\sum}} \tilde{f}_k$

Unimodal has a single clear peak/mode
Bimodal has 2 peaks
Multimodal has 2+ peaks

Arg max $f(x)$:
	The points $x$ where $f(x)$ attains the largest value
Arg min $f(x)$:
	The points $x$ where $f(x)$ attains the smallest value

Some values in data are substantially different, these are extreme values/outliers. This definition is contextual 
One way to define outliers is values outside the interval:
	$[q_{25} - 1.5 IQR, q_{75} + 1.5 IQR]$
