Proof by Exhaustion:
	If a statement relates to a small finite set it can be proved or disproved by considering all elements in the set

Proof by Counter-Example:
	You can disprove a universal statement by finding an example

Proof by Contraposition:
	Some problems $p \to q$ are easier to solve as $¬q \to ¬p$

Proof involving IFF:
	To prove $p \leftrightarrow q$ you must prove $p \to q$ and $q \to p$

Proof by Contradiction:
	To prove $p$ assume $¬p$ is true and find a contradiction

Proof by Induction:
	TODO

Proof $\sqrt 2$ is irrational:
	Use proof by contradiction
	Assume $\sqrt 2 = \dfrac{m}{n}$
	Assume $\dfrac{m}{n}$ is in its simplest form
	$n \sqrt 2 = m$
	$2 n^2 = m^2 \to m^2$ is even $\to$ m is even $\to m = 2k$
	$2n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$
	$n^2 = 2k^2 \to n$ is even $\to n$ is even $\to n = 2p$
	$\sqrt 2 = \dfrac{2k}{2p}$
	$\dfrac{m}{n}$ is not in its simplest form
