For anything involving matrices:
	GO SLOWLY!!!! DO NOT DO STEPS IN YOUR HEAD!!
# Calculus
Any question that includes $\int xe^{ax}$ probably expects you to substitute $u = ax$

Don't forget $+ \ C$

Remember that:
$\dfrac{d}{dx} e^{f(x)} = (\dfrac{d}{dx} f(x)) e^{f(x)}$
$\int e^{f(x)} = (\dfrac{d}{dx} f(x))^{-1} e^{f(x)}$

Be aware of sometimes needing to use integration by parts on single term logarithmic integrands

Be aware that certain questions will require you to split fractions, complete squares or factorise to change the form of an expression before being able to integrate
Anything involving $\sqrt{}$ check the log book as there's special integrations
