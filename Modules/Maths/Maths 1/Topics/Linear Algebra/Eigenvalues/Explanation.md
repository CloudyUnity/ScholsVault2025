$A \mathbf v = \lambda \mathbf v$
Find $\lambda$ (The Eigenvalues) and $\mathbf v$ (The Eigenvectors)

$A \mathbf v = \lambda \mathbf v$
$(A - \lambda I) \mathbf v = \mathbf 0$
$det(A - \lambda I) = 0$
This is the characteristic equation

When expanded we get the characteristic polynomial:
	$a \lambda^3 + b \lambda^2 + c \lambda + d = 0$

Find the roots of the polynomial

$\lambda  \in \mathbb{Z}$ for this module
	(In practice $\lambda \in \mathbb{C}$)

The number of times an eigenvalue is repeated is its algebraic multiplicity 

The number of eigenvectors corresponding with an eigenvalue is its geometric multiplicity 

Geometric multiplicity $\leq$ Algebraic multiplicity

The set of eigenvectors for an eigenvalue is its eigenspace

To find the eigenvectors solve $(A - \lambda I) \mathbf v = \mathbf 0$ using gaussian elimination
	See how it looks like $A \mathbf x = \mathbf b$
