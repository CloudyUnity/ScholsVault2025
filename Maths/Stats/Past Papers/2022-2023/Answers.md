# Q5

(a) Scatterplot
(b) Use calculator to compute r, the result is r = 0.5683280943 or r = 0.568, The value suggests that there is a weak correlation between the two variables.
(c) the formula of r can be given by r = a + bx, where r is the correlation coefficient, a is the intercept and b is the slope of the line, most calculators will compute these values automatically.
  a = 1.35
  b = 1.70
  These values suggest that the values are correlated, as the slope is positive and that we predict the y value to be at 1.35 when x is at 0
  #questionable #manual_calculations_needed
- They are, the data points do seem to trend upwards in a logorithmic fashion, which explains the positive slope, i.e the value of b, since most data  points are near or above the 0 mark, a y intercept of 1.35 seems reasonable, these values are as such in line with what we would have expected
  #debatable 
- The formula for any point in a residual plot can be defined as $r_{i} = y_{i} - (a + bx_{i})$
  
  There are four assumptions for simple linear regression.
