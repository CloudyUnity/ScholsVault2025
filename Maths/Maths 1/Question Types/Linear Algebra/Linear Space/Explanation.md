A basis of $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a set of $m$ linearly independent vectors that form a complete set

An orthonormal basis is a basis where the vectors are orthogonal and normalized 

The columns of a $m \times m$ matrix A form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^m$ is it has a non-zero determinant

A subspace V of $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a nonempty subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$ which is closed under addition and scalar multiplication
	$\overline v \in V \land \overline w \in V \to \overline v + \overline w \in V$
	$\overline v \in V \land c \in \mathbb{R} \to c \overline v \in V$

Every subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ always contains $\overline 0$

The number of vectors making up a subspace basis is known as its dimension

The columns of $I$ forms the standard basis for $\mathbb{R}^m$

The null space $\mathcal{N}(A)$ is the set of vectors $\overline x$ such that $A \overline x = \overline  0$	
	$\mathcal{N}(A) = \mathcal{N}(RRE(A))$

The column space $\mathcal{C}(A)$ is the span of the columns of $A$
	Find the span by computing the RRE of $A$ 
	The columns with leading ones are the corresponding columns that form the basis for A
