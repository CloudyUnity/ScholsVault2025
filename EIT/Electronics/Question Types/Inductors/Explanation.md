Inductor:
	A two-terminal element which stores energy in its magnetic field
	Ability to store energy given by its "Inductance"
	Is a solenoid
	Enhanced by a ferrite core (High magnetic permeability)

Inductance ($L$):
	Total magnetic flux threading the inductor
	Equation for current TODO
	Length, area, turns equation TODO
	Unit = Henry (Scalar)

Henry ($H$):
	Inductance of an inductor which has 1$A$ and 1$Wb$ flux in its core

Back-EMF:
	Counter-electromotive force ($CEMF$)
	The $emf$ manifesting as a voltage that opposes the change in current which induced it
	Can exceed the supply voltage for a short period

Inductors in series:
	$L = L_1 + L_2 + \dots + L_n$

Inductors in parallel:
	$\dfrac{1}{L} = \dfrac{1}{L_1} + \dfrac{1}{L_2} + \dots + \dfrac{1}{L_n}$

Inductor Examples:
	Car spark plugs, used to ignite fuel
