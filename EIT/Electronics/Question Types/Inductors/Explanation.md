Inductor:
	A two-terminal element which stores energy in its magnetic field
	Ability to store energy given by its "Inductance"
	Is a solenoid
	Enhanced by a ferrite core (High magnetic permeability)

Inductance ($L$):
	Total magnetic flux threading the inductor
	Equation for current TODO
	Length, area, turns equation TODO
	Unit = Henry (Scalar)

Henry ($H$):
	Inductance of an inductor which has 1$A$ and 1$Wb$ flux in its core

Webbers ($Wb$):
	TODO (Can be moved to another section)

Back-EMF:
	TODO
	Can exceed the supply voltage for a short period

Inductors in series:
	TODO

Inductors in parallel:
	TODO

Inductor Examples:
	Car spark plugs, used to ignite fuel
