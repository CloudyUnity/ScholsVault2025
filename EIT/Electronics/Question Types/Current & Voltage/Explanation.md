Charge ($q$):
	A difference in number between the protons and electrons
	Causes matter to experience a force in an electromagnetic field
	Differences attract, like repel like

Coulomb's Law:
	Force between any two point charges is proportional to the product of the charges 
		$F = k q_1 q_2$
	Force between any two point charges is inversely proportional to the square distance between them
		$F = k \dfrac{1}{|AB|}$

Potential Energy: The energy of a body due to state or position

Voltage (Electrical Potential Difference):
	The p.d. between two points is the work done bringing a unit positive charge from one point to another
	Current flows from high voltage to low voltage
	Unit = Volt (Scalar)

Volt ($V$):
	1 joule of work bringing a charge of 1 coulomb between two points

Electromotive Force ($emf$):
	Work done bringing a positive charge around a closed loop
	The supply voltage

Current ($I$):
	Charge flow per time
	Unit = Ampere (Scalar)

Ampere ($A$):
	$A = C/s$
	A constant current maintained in two straight parallel conductors, 1m apart in a vacuum, causes each to exert a force of $2\times 10^{-7} N$ 

Coulomb ($C$):
	A quantity of charge transferred when 1$A$ flows for 1 second

Joules ($J$):
	Unit of energy in the SI 
	Equal to the work done when 1N displaces a mass by 1m in the direction of the force
	Equal to the energy dissipated as heat when 1$A$ passes through 1$\ohm$ for 1 second

Root Mean Square (RMS):
	If a current is AC the voltage given is implicitly RMS
	The RMS of an AC produces the same heat as an equivalent DC
	Graphical Method:
		$V_{RMS} = \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum^n V_i^2}{n}}$
			$V_i$ is a mid-ordinate voltage (Calculate the voltage at each $i$ time period for the first 180 degrees quantized into $n$ parts)
	Analytical Method:
		$V_{RMS} = \dfrac{V_{pk}}{\sqrt 2}$

Ideal Power Sources:
	Ideal Voltage Source:
		Provides a stable voltage (AC or DC)
		A two terminal element where the voltage across the terminals is specified at every instant of time and doesn't depend on the current
	Ideal Current Source:
		Provides a stable current (AC or DC)
		A two terminal element where the current flowing is specified at every instant of time and does not depend on the load connected to it

Charge Info:
	Charge is quantized in integer multiples of "elementary charge"
	Elementary Charge $\approx 1.602 \times 10^{-19}$ C
	Protons have a charge of $+e$ in the standard model
	Electrons have a charge of $-e$ in the standard model
	Quarks have smaller charges of multiples of $\dfrac{1}{3} e$ 
	Unit = Coulomb (C) / Ampere-Hour ($Ah$) / Elementary Charge ($e$) / Faraday Constant (1 mole of $e$)
