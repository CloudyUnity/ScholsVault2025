Electric Field:
	An electric field forms between two points with an electrical potential difference
	Its intensity at a point is the force per unit positive charge at that point
	Equation: TODO
	Unit = N/C or V/m (Vector)

Electric Flux:
	TODO

Electrical Current and Magnetism:
	Currents attract if moving in the same direction, repel if opposite
	This phenomenon is defined by the ampere ($A$)
	When charges move (electric current) they each exert forces, aka have a magnetic field
	The magnetic field rotates around the current axis right-handed
		Point thumb in current direction, follow wrapping of fingers

Magnetic Pole/Charge:
	A pole of 1 $Wb$ takes 1 $J$ to move around 1 $A$
	Magnetic poles are an abstraction, not physical

Magnetic Field Strength (MFS):
	 MFS at a point is the force per unit positive magnetic pole at that point
	 Unit = $A$ (Vector)

Magnetic Flux Density (MFD):
	MFD at a point is the force per unit positive electric charge moving at 1m/s normal to the magnetic field direction
	Unit = Tesla (Vector)

Magnetic Flux:
	TODO

Tesla ($T$):
	$T = Wb/m^2$
	$T$ is a Vector

In electric fields the force on a charge points in the direction of positive to negative
In magnetic fields the force on a moving charge is perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field

Lorentz Force Law:
	TODO

Ampere's Law for an Infinite Straight Wire:
	TODO

Faraday's Law:
	A changing magnetic flux threading a conductor induces an $emf$ according to:
		TODO
	Applications:
		Electric guitars have a magnet to induce magnetism in the strings, vibrating strings cause a changing flux in the coil resulting in small varying voltage fed into an amplifier and speaker
		Microphones have a coil and magnet which vibrate from sound waves inducing voltage 
		Electrical power generation has a coil rotated by kinetic energy (Turbines) through a magnetic field. EMF appears at the brushes powering the circuit. Makes an AC power supply

Lenz's Law:
	A conductor solenoid with n turns something something idfk
	TODO
