Before 1950 electronics used vacuum tubes/valves as transistors. They were large and created lots of heat
I don't know if more information is needed on the history

Enhancement Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (E-MOSFET):
	These have fast switching speeds which is good for processors
	Easy to manufacture, can be used as a resistor or capacitor 
	Less gain than the Bipolar Junction Transistor however
	N-Channel E-MOSFET:

		N-Channel is also called an inversion layer
		Why does the dielectric become negative closer to the gate though? 
			TODO find an answer

Building Logic Gates:

		When the gate is HIGH the transistor connects to ground and the voltage leaving X is LOW
		When the gate is LOW the voltage goes straight from Vcc to X HIGH

Amplifiers:

	$V_{in}$ is AC
	$V_{DD}$ is DC
	Capacitors prevent backflow
	TODO:
		Solve for each variable, idfk how it's confusin
