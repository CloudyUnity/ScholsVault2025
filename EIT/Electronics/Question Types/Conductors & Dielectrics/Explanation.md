Conductor: Material which an $emf$ facilitates current to adequately
	Aka electrons will move in the direction of the anode
	The materials electrons are loosely bound
	Examples: Silver

Semiconductor: Material which an $emf$ facilitates current to moderately
	Examples: Silicon, Germanium

Dielectric: Material which an $emf$ facilitates current to poorly
	These materials electrons are tightly bound
	Examples: Pretty much everything that's not a metal
	Also called Insulators
