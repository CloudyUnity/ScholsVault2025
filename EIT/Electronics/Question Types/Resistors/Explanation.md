Resistor:
	A two terminal element which impedes flow of electrical current
	Converts electrical energy into another form (Heat, light, etc)
	Unit = Ohms (Scalar)
	Every material has at least some resistance, "Resistors" are "Ohmic Materials"
		These have a linear relationship between applied voltage and current

Ohms ($\ohm$):
	Unit of electrical resistance
	$\ohm = \dfrac{V}{A} = \dfrac{W}{A^2} = \dfrac{V^2}{W} = \dfrac{H}{s} = \dfrac{Wb}{C}$

Ohm's Law:
	$V = IR$

Joules Law:
	$P = VI = \dfrac{V^2}{R} = I^2 R$

Non-ideal power sources can be modelled using a resistor 
	In series for voltage sources
	In parallel for current sources

Batteries have internal resistance
	If $R_{internal}$ is very small we can consider the source ideal

Resistors in Series:
	$R = R_1 + R_2 + \dots + R_n$

Resistors in Parallel:
	$\dfrac{1}{R} = \dfrac{1}{R_1} + \dfrac{1}{R_2} + \dots + \dfrac{1}{R_n}$

The Potential Divider:
	A circuit that divides a voltage into smaller voltages
	Has two resisters in series
	$V_o = V_i \dfrac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$
	Used for volume controls in audio equipment
