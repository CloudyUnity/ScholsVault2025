Resistor:
	A two terminal element which impedes flow of electrical current
	Converts electrical energy into another form (Heat, light, etc)
	Unit = Ohms (Scalar)
	Every material has at least some resistance, "Resistors" are "Ohmic Materials"
		These have a linear relationship between applied voltage and current

Ohms ($\ohm$):
	TODO

Ohm's Law:
	$V = IR$

Non-ideal power sources can be modelled using a resistor 
	In series for voltage sources
	In parallel for current sources

Batteries have internal resistance
	If $R_{internal}$ is very small we can consider the source ideal

Resistors in Series:
	$R = R_1 + R_2 + \dots + R_n$

Resistors in Parallel:
	$\dfrac{1}{R} = \dfrac{1}{R_1} + \dfrac{1}{R_2} + \dots + \dfrac{1}{R_n}$

The Potential Divider:
