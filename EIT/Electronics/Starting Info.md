Prefixes:
$m = milli (\frac{1}{1000})$
$\mu = micro (10^{-6})$
$n = nano (10^{-9})$
$p = pico (10^{-12})$

Anode:
	Positively charged side of a circuit

Cathode:
	Negatively charged side of a circuit

Earthing:
	Metal parts not used in internal circuitry are connected with an earth wire (Green and yellow)
	If a live wire comes in contact with the metal the current flows to the earth 
		This is a path of less resistance than the human body
	Also see lightning rods and car static dischargers

Live wires are brown
Neutral wires are blue

Grounding:
	In a circuit there could be a potential difference of 5$V$ 
	But the absolute potentials with respect to earth (0$V$) could be 115$V$ and 110$V$
	For analysis we assign the return wire a potential of 0$V$ 
		This is called the ground wire or "zero reference"

Conventions:
	Current is said to flow from positive to negative. PRANKED IDIOT
		Electrons flow from negative to positive

Load:
	An electrical component in a circuit that consumes power

$\alpha cos(x) + \beta sin(x) = R cos (x - \alpha)$
	$R = \sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2}$

Solenoid:
	A coil of wire (e.g. springs, inductors, etc)

Electrical Power:
	Rate of energy expenditure
	$J/s$ or Watts ($W$)
