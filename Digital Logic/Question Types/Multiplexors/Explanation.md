Multiplexors have n selection lines and $2^n$ input lines
Taking the selection lines as a binary number 0 to $2^n$, the corresponding input line is passed to the output line

Demultiplexors pass 1 input line to one of $2^n$ output lines

In telecommunications muxing is used to combine analog signals into one data stream
