The schols is composed of 4 papers
	Maths & Stats | 4/6 Qs | 3 hrs | 30%
	Programming | 2 Qs     | 2 hrs | 25%
	Science           | 3 Qs     | 2 hrs | 22.5%
	Systems          | 3 Qs     | 2 hrs | 22.5%

"Broadly based on your first three semesters"
	Aka it's possible to get asked questions you've not seen in the course like multithreading
		Although in these cases they will explain the topic first
Takes place between 6-10th January 2025
Announced on 21st of april

You need to apply for two online forms, once in 30th September, another in November
There is a presentation coming at some point in October(?) with a Q&A at the end so be ready for that

Code must all be handwritten so start getting good at writing bugless code
Answer every question
	You have time for all 6 questions in maths even though only 4 are counted
Math papers from 2016 on are a good basis 
	Also see this book (A tour through mathematical logic by Robert Wolf)
		https://pdfcoffee.com/r-wolf-a-tour-through-mathematical-logic-pdf-free.html
Ask your lecturers questions because they like to give hints
Also pay attention during lectures for hints
Last year Hitesh just stole the sudoku problem from geeks4geeks, will they do it again? Learn some similar difficult algos that have not appeared before
	Hitesh will likely be writing this years
Possibly ignore some math papers (2019, 2024, #todo)
	Why? Is this even true? #todo
Maths 3 put emphasis on set proofs (Proof sets are equal)
All waldron questions are taken from some book he recommended 
Elec is know for repeating questions, not guaranteed 
John Stalker writes weirder/harder questions than andrea for maths 3
Syntax errors don't matter for programming, you could almost write it in another language and get full marks. All that matters is the approach
	Except in ARM where it does matter
You don't need to import libraries/header files in code
You bring your own calculator, don't bring a log book
Sometimes if a hard paper causes everyone to get low marks they will mark it easier
You won't get told the authors, you need to email people directly
Stats is extremely theory heavy, can be memorised for free marks but it's a shit load of content
Learn how smart pointers, atomics, locks, etc work in detail 
	#todo 
Check out the recommended books by profs to find sample questions (Maths)
Learn about various optimizations for ARM, look over memcpy assignment

To pass:
	Get an average of +70%
	Get +70% in at least 2/4 papers
	Get +65% in all papers

Two people won 2 years ago (2023)
	@spy727 (Daniel)
	@yellowdragoon (Henry?)
	23 sat CS schols 
1 person won the year before (2022)
Keep in mind last year they had 160 people instead of the usual 100
A lot of people did much better in the maths paper than others 2 years ago so maybe expect the others to get easier or maths to get harder?
Pre-announcement a lot of people thought comp sci went bad, after announcement comp sys turned out to fuck people over
I don't have much info from last year but afaik 2 people won it for CS
