	@yellowdragoon (Henry?)
	23 sat CS schols 
1 person won the year before (2022)
Keep in mind last year they had 160 people instead of the usual 100
A lot of people did much better in the maths paper than others 2 years ago so maybe expect the others to get easier or maths to get harder?
Pre-announcement a lot of people thought comp sci went bad, after announcement comp sys turned out to fuck people over
I don't have much info from last year but afaik 2 people won it for CS
